## Who we are?

Since 2001 PayCore provides innovative end-to-end payment solutions for financial institutions, processors, telecom operators, personalization bureaus, retailers, terminal/card vendors, and last but not least public transportation authorities to more than 185 customers in 35 countries across the globe.

PayCore offers peace of mind to its clients with its award-winning scalable and robust solutions that work flawlessly with multiple technologies and platforms. PayCore provides full flexibility as well as offers a complete set of fast and secure payment solutions that takes away the need of working with multiple vendors, and achieves the highest compliance standards.

With 18 years of experience in EMV and well-established products such as card payment solutions, central/instant card personalization, transaction management, fraud/risk management, and hardware solutions, PayCore is also a leading player in emerging mobile payment, open-loop transit, and wearable payment technologies. PayCore’s PCI DSS, BKM, MasterCard and Visa certified Processing Center is serving over 50 customers with its reliable infrastructure.

PayCore’s dedication finds its roots in its founders who are still actively involved in the management of the company. Building on their vision and state-of-the-art engineering, PayCore has had the opportunity to bring to market over 20 “Global First” projects, from the first contactless credit card back in 2006 with Garanti BBVA, to the first contactless prepaid card for public transportation in India with Axis Bank and NPCI in 2015.
